const topicAdjudicationPrompt = `You are maintaining a list of the subjects one person follows. Below are the "existing topics" and the "newly observed phrasings".

For each new phrasing, decide whether it and some existing topic **refer to the same thing** - the same thing, not merely a related one.

When they are the same thing and one of the two names is clearly more complete or more accurate, put the name worth keeping in label:
- "CI pipeline" and "continuous integration pipeline" -> label takes the full form "continuous integration pipeline".
- "PostgreSQL connection pool" and "PostgreSQL connection pool tuning" -> label takes the more specific one.
- If the two names are about equally good, leave label empty.
- **Never** invent a broader name ("stores", "the system", "database stuff"), and never join the two names together ("A and B"). A name may only become more precise, never more general - otherwise every merge widens the topic a little and it ends up a bucket that holds everything.

Count as the same thing:
- Synonyms, rephrasings, or the same thing at different levels of detail: "staff rota planning" and "store shift management".
- An incidental qualifier added: "PostgreSQL connection pool" and "PostgreSQL connection pool issue".

Do not count as the same thing:
- Different problems in the same area: "PostgreSQL connection pool" and "PostgreSQL backup and restore".
- One is a **specific query** within the scope of the other: an existing "store shift management" against a new phrasing "the rota for store 3 next Wednesday" - the latter does fall in the former's area, but it is a one-off query, not the same standing interest. Judge these different.
- One is a narrower concept of the other: "databases" and "PostgreSQL connection pool".

When in doubt, judge them different. A wrong merge mixes the counts of two subjects together and is invisible afterwards; a missed merge only leaves one extra row for now.
